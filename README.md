**About me**
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @svilupp!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Bayesian and Causal Inference, because the world is a an uncertain place ready to be intervened on!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Probably the best way is right here!

 
**Why?**
I hope to share several examples of interesting models that I have worked in my personal capacity:
- Hierarchical Bayesian platform for outlier detection in event data (Numpyro multilevel model)
- An interactive business case with full on uncertainty (Bayesian model with priors elicited from SMEs, delivered as an interactive data app in Streamlit)
- Can you beat a memory-based recommender with extremely sparse interaction data? (LightFM case study)


And something for fun
- Deep (not deep-dish! pure Napoli-style!) pizza classifier - how many samples does it take to tell Double pepperoni and Margharita apart?
- Why do we wait so much in NHS hospitals? (Discrete-event-simulation-based case study)
