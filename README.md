**About me**

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @svilupp!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Bayesian and Causal Inference, because the world is an uncertain place ready to be intervened on!
- ðŸŽ¯ My aspiration is unlocking Generative AI's 100x potential (ðŸ”— see my blog: svilupp.github.io or try my packages: PromptingTools, LLMTextAnalysis, AIHelpMe)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Probably the best way is right here or on Julia Slack!

**Why this repo?**

Things get outdated quickly...

I hope to share several examples of interesting models that I have worked on in my personal capacity:
- Causal inference for better sleep - How restful would your sleep be with 1) a weighted blanket and 2) CBD drops? (EconML and generative modelling case study with OURA ring data)
- Hierarchical Bayesian models for outlier detection in deeply nested event data (Numpyro multilevel model with multivariate COPULA-based wrapper on top)
- An interactive business case with full-on uncertainty (Bayesian model with a tool for priors elicitation from SMEs, delivered as an interactive data app in Streamlit)
- Can you beat a simple memory-based recommendation when you have extremely sparse interaction data? (LightFM case study)


And something just for fun
- Deep (not deep-dish! pure Napoli-style!) pizza classifier, ie, how many samples does it take to tell Double pepperoni and Margharita apart?
- Why do we wait so much in NHS hospitals? (Discrete-event-simulation-based case study)
